# Pattern Recognition ~ Speech & Language Processing Labs

The repo will host the lab assignments for Pattern Recognition and Speech and Language Processing courses in ECE NTUA.

# Python Introductory Lab

The repo includes also the introductory lab for Pattern Recognition and Speech and Language Processing in
NTUA. Material covers an introduction to Python, NumPy and matplotlib. Some of the material is adapted from [this
tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) in cs231n course at Stanford.

# Virtual Machines

To ease the setup process we provide a virtual machine for each course with the required
software preinstalled. To run the virtual machine you need to download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Then you need to open a terminal and run:
```
# For Pattern Recognition course
cd <path/to>/python-lab
cp Vagrantfile.patreco Vagrantfile
vagrant up
```
or
```
# For Speech and Language Processing course
cd <path/to>/python-lab
cp Vagrantfile.slp Vagrantfile
vagrant up
```
Setup will take a while, since it installs all dependencies. When the setup is finished, a jupyter notebook will start in the machine. Navigate to the URL printed. Changes to files will be saved automatically to your current working directory.

To access the console inside the VM use
```
vagrant ssh
```
To stop the VM use
```
vagrant halt
```
